        <p>While Simpson and Elliot have quite contradicting approaches to how Indigenous peoples and the Government should move forward, our education model takes into consideration aspects from both arguments.</p>
        <p>Simpson argues that the Indigenous peoples should assimilate to Western culture and quit their traditional ways. He claims that they are too reliant on the Crown and should contribute to the rest of society. His point of view focuses on the economic value and lack of it.</p>
        <p>Our model incorporate his ideology to an extent. Having higher level education available to Indigenous communities will give them the opportunity to be self sufficient and eventually non-reliant on the Crown. This educational opportunity will give them the resources needed to go back to a non-waged based community in this changing ecological environment.</p>
        <p>Elliot argues that the only solution of the exploitation of Indigenous peoples is creating sovereignty within the Indigenous community. Canada must recognize the right to self-determination and take note of the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples.</p>

        <p>Our model embodies Elliotâ€™s outlook of creating the nation within nation solution for Indigenous peoples. Doing so by providing Indigenous peoples with higher level educational opportunities within their communities. This is done whilst keeping their adapting ecological needs, cultural and spiritual traditions all into consideration when creating curriculum.  Using this e-learning model will eventually abolish the need for individuals outside the community to fill job positions, removing the high turnover rate alongside the cultural and spiritual barriers Indigenous communities are currently suffering from. This framework will meet the same education standard as Western communities, therefore, creating a fair and equal structure for Indigenous peoples throughout Canada. These factors correlate with Elliot ideology of reconciling for past nation to nation issues, between the federal government and Indigenous peoples such as the shade of residential schools, underfunding and support from the federal government.
