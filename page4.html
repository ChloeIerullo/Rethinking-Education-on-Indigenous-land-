          <p>Narrowing this sustainable model into Attawapiskat, a First Nations community is highly desirable in such a remote location across Canada. Air travel is the only used form of transporting goods to Attawapiskat therefore would be used for this model to distribute the initial resources needed. The beneficial aspect of this model is that once the preliminary resources are transported and arranged, there will rarely be any need for future shipments unless there are technical issues. This model uses an ethernet network base therefore there will be no internet signal issues although it may not be as fast as the networks implemented in the South. Attawapiskat is in a secluded area however the ethernet connection will be sufficient for members in the community to further their knowledge in the online education.</p>
          <p>The Attawapiskat community spent $11 million dollars from April 2017 to March 2018 on education, which means their community is certainly willing to invest in good education for generations to come. Since this First Nations community values education, with a small amount of extra funding for implementation their community would likley adopt this modle. In this community, there is already an elementary school in place therefore many First Nations children have the basis of knowledge to further their education. The current Attawapiskat website includes job postings for health services such as a mental health clinician.            </p>

          <p>Today, the Attawapiskat community has institutions such as an elementary school, high school, hospital, airport, police station, and an Inn. By incorporating this online education model in the community it will give the First Nations people the power and education they need to work in these establishments. By doing so, the Canadian government would not need to hire people from Western communities to fulfill job positions any longer. As Attawapiskat members will have the opportunity to work in these fields. This means that the First Nations can fully take back their land and become a non-waged based community once again. </p>
          <p>Students will have the opportunity to stay in their community while continuing their traditional practice and not only gaining knowledge but also experience through placements. These placements can include fields like health services, hospitality and tourism, policing, and teaching which all can be accomplished on their land.</p>
