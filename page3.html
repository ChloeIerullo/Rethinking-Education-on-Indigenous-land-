        <h3>Funding</h3>
        <p>This higher level of education online school will be funded by the federal government as they are currently financially supporting the Indigenous communities across Canada. Although the provincial government is responsible for education, they are not currently responsible for Indigenous educational affairs as this still falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction. Therefore, it is expected that the provincial government would not have the resources available to coordination this model effectively and simultaneously across all thirteen provinces and territories. Furthermore,  It is most ideal for the federal government to fund this model because they can evenly distribute financial aid and resources across Indigenous communities with the amount of insight they will collect from across the country. </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>This model requires an online educational system as well as physical equipment such as computers, powerlines, and an internet network. This model will be highly inexpensive when it comes to supplies since all resources will be available electronically. Financial expenses can be even further reduced by using existing infrastructure to apply this sustainable model. The most complex goal to achieve will be the social aspect. Every community will need to be assessed for what courses should be available and how the curriculum will be modified to suit their cultural and spiritual traditions. A yearly mandatory assessment on what the curriculum for the environmental adaptations course must incorporate will also be a necessity as ecological factors are changing rapidly. The implementation of this framework must also consider the prior education levels of future Indigenous students, as their prior education may not be as thorough as western students and may widely differ between communities. For this reason, the implementation of each educational program across different Indigenous communities will need to be highly customizable. </p>
        <h3>Cultural and Spiritual Consideration</h3>
        <p>Indigenous elders could oppose this idea of online education because it does not follow their traditional and cultural ways. It is probable to say that younger generations of Indigenous peoples will be more inclined to adopt this education model, even though it incorporates technology. This model is a source of adaptation to the current political and ecological climate change, while still keeping Indigenous traditions on the forefront.  Although this framework incorporates Western science, such as technology and internet, it will allow the members of Indigenous communities to not be displaced from their loved ones and traditional ways while gaining knowledge, experience and a higher level education. Therefore, it is highly anticipated that some members of the community will not be thrilled by the incorporation of technology in their communities but will be more inclined to conform with this model as young Indigenous adults will no longer have to be displaced from their communities to have a higher level education. </p>
        <h3>Environmental Considerations</h3>
        <p>This educational model will provide environmental and sustainable education on fluctuating ecological systems. This is especially desirable in the North where there are major issues with climate change that will continue to occur for years to come. To retain the least amount of radiation, this model will not use wireless internet, creating a more sustainable and ecologically friendly resource. This consideration would be less detrimental to Indigenous communities and their sacred wildlife such as the Caribou who have never been exposed to radiation waves. One of the major goals of creating this sustainable model is to preserve natural habitats and producing the least amount of CO2 possible, all while providing a respectable education.

          Today, Indigenous youth lack the educational attainment and adult skills compared to other young non-Indigenous individuals especially in the Canadian North (Jeffrey, Fiser, Brender & Dowdall, 2015). It is crucial to support young Indigenous peoples and guide them through post-secondary and further education because it is essential for their success and economic future of the North and Canada as a nation (Jeffrey et al., 2015). Providing Indigenous youth improved educational opportunities will also be crucial for the rise of an economic and prosperous North in the wake of climate change. Our model will improve educational outcomes in the Indigenous communities, alongside improving economic development in Canada’s North all while equalizing opportunities for a nation within a nation resolution.
