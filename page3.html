        <h3>Funding</h3>
        <p>The online school will be funded by the federal government as they are currently financially supporting the Indigenous community. Although the provincial government is responsible for education, they do not have the resources available to implement this model and distribute it across the provinces and territories. It is most ideal for the federal government to fund this model because they can evenly distribute financial aid and resources across provinces with the amount of insight they have of Indigenous communities.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>This model requires an online database educational system and physical equipment such as computers, powerlines, and internet network. A way to reduce financial expenses would be using existing infrastructure to apply this sustainable model. The implementation of this model must also consider the prior education levels of future Indigenous students, as their prior education may not be as thorough as western students. For this reason the implementation of each educational program will take into consideration the individual students current educational level.</p>
        <h3>Cultural and Spiritual Consideration</h3>
        <p>Indigenous elders could oppose this idea of online education because it does not follow their traditional and cultural ways. This model is a source of adaptation to the current political and ecological climate change. Younger generation Indigenous peoples make up most of the population in these communities and will more likely be open and inclined to operate this model even with the incorporation of Western technology. The online educational model considers the Indigenous cultural and spiritual traditional ways by incorporating their ideologies while integrating Western science such as technology and the internet. This model will allow all students to gain valuable knowledge and experience, all while staying on their land and continuing to take part in their communities traditional practices.</p>
        <h3>Environmental Considerations</h3>
        <p>This educational model will provide environmental and sustainable education on fluctuating ecological systems. This is especially desirable in the North where there are major issues with climate change that will continue to occur for years to come. To retain the least amount of radiation, this model will not use wireless internet, creating a more sustainable and ecologically friendly resource. This consideration would be less detrimental to Indigenous communities and their sacred wildlife such as the Caribou who have never been exposed to radiation waves. One of the major goals of creating this sustainable model is to preserve natural habitats and producing the least amount of CO2 possible.</p>
